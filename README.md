# PharmaStock

PharmaStock is a website that helps small pharmacies keep track of their medicine. It helps them stop wasting money on expired drugs and makes sure they never run out of what patients need.

# What It Does

**Track Medicine:** Keep a list of how much medicine is on the shelf.

**Watch Expiration Dates:** Get alerts before medicine goes bad so it doesn't go to waste.

**Easy Dashboard:** See everything that needs attention in one simple view.

**Secure Login:** Keep data safe by letting only staff and bosses sign in.

# Smart AI Alerts
This app uses AI (Machine Learning) to help with ordering.

The AI learns which medicines sell the fastest.

It sends an alert early for popular drugs so you don't run out.

For medicines that don't sell often, it waits longer to send an alert.

# The Tech Stack

**Frontend:** Angular (for the part you see).

**Backend:** C# and ASP.NET Core (for the logic).

**Database:** PostgreSQL or SQL Server (to save your data).

# Front End Setup
